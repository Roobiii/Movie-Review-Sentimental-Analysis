**Movie Review Sentiment Analysis**
**Overview**
This project performs sentiment analysis on movie reviews using machine learning techniques. It aims to predict whether a movie review is positive or negative based on the text content of the review.

**Features**
Dataset: Uses a dataset of movie reviews with labeled sentiment (positive or negative).
Preprocessing: Text preprocessing steps include tokenization, removing stop words, and vectorization.
Modeling: Implements machine learning models such as SVM, Naive Bayes, and deep learning models like LSTM for sentiment classification.
Evaluation: Evaluates model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Deployment: Demonstrates how to deploy the model for inference, either locally or in a cloud environment.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, nltk, tensorflow (or pytorch), flask (for deployment)
Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your_username/movie-review-sentiment-analysis.git
Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Download necessary NLTK data:
python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
Usage
Training
Data Preparation: Ensure your dataset is in a suitable format (e.g., CSV, JSON).
Preprocessing: Run preprocessing scripts to tokenize text, remove stopwords, and convert text data into numerical form.
Model Training: Train machine learning or deep learning models on the processed data.
Evaluation
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics.
Visualization: Optionally, visualize model performance using graphs or plots.
Deployment
Model Deployment: Deploy the trained model using Flask or another framework for web applications.
Inference: Provide instructions on how to make predictions using the deployed model.
Example
Training Example:

python train.py --dataset data/movie_reviews.csv --model svm
Deployment Example:
python app.py
